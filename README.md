## Rails has many

Objectives    
* Create models that will have a have many and a belongs to relationships
* Show how "parent" and "child" relationships are created.


Will we start by creating a relationship between Albums and songs. 
An album will "have many" songs. And a song will "belong to", or be a child of an Album.

In the lab sections students will create a relationship between authors and books. The Author will be the "parent" and the Book will be a "child" of the Author. These terms will become more clear as we work through this lesson.


* Draw a relationship between a Album and a Song.  

We have created an Album resource already in this app.
